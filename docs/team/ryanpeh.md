### Project: AddressBook Level 3

**SmartNUS** is a desktop app specifically designed for students to revise for their exams. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=ryanpeh)


* **New Feature**: Implemented quiz functionality and user interface
  * What it does: 
  * Justification: This is the main feature of **SmartNUS**, as the application is designed to promote active recall through quizzing yourself.
  * Highlights: 

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())
  
* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
  * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
  * Integrated a new Github plugin (CodeCov) to the team repo
